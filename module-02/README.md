## About std::roundf

std::roundf is a C++ standard library function that is used to round a floating-point number to the nearest integer, using the "round half to even" rounding mode. It is specifically designed to work with single-precision floating-point numbers (floats).

The "round half to even" rounding mode is also known as "banker's rounding" or "unbiased rounding." In this mode, when a number is exactly halfway between two integers, it rounds to the nearest even integer. For example, if you're rounding the number 2.5, it would round to 2 (the nearest even integer), while 3.5 would also round to 4 (the nearest even integer).
